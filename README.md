# SplicePredictor

:octocat: â€‹A task of functional sites finding in genetic DNA. 


## Overview

This is a re-implementation of predicting donor & acceptor splice site signals using 3 different models. 

### Weight Array (WAM)

An optimized frequency-based method to predict splice site patterns with the weight array model. At bottom, a weight array method continues to extract splice signals, count the frequencies of nucleotides and fill the matrices, identical with the conditional weight matrices (WMM). What we can use to distinguish WAM from WMM is that WAM takes into account the correspondence between current position and an adjoining position, which we certify conducive to promote accuracy of splice site prediction. See [Zhang et al. (1993)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/9/5/499/349215?redirectedFrom=fulltext) for a reference.

### Bayesian Network (BN)

A probabilistic graphical model which considers long range interdependency among nucleotide sequences by learning a direct acyclic graph (DAG), finding all of the conditional probabilities for each of the variables which will be used to search for missing labels of the testing sequences. See [Chen et al. (2005)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/21/4/471/203185?login=true) for a reference. BNs are implemented using [Pgmpy](http://pgmpy.org/) and [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/).

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A discriminant analysis method to predict splice site patterns, the principle of which is to map samples linear-inseparable in the primal n-dimension feature space to a higher dimension feature space where they become linear-separable by mathematical transformations. See [Chen et al. (2005)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/21/4/471/203185?login=true) for a reference. SVMs are implemented using [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) based on [LibSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/). [Thundersvm](https://thundersvm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is recommended as a substitute for `sklearn.svm` to support GPU training.

For details, see `./Docs`. 

## Quick Start

To **train a model** and **evaluate with a set threshold**, just run `wam.py`, `bn.py` or `svm.py` in `./Model`:

~~~bash
$ python wam.py
~~~

A `.model` file will be saved in `./Model/donor` or `./Model/acceptor` accordingly based on the site type you prefer. 

Then, you may **get plotting** by your trained model in `./Utils`:

~~~bash
$ python plot.py # You may set the model types in plot.py first
~~~

You may check `./Pics` for Precision - Recall curves and ROC curves. In addition, a `.csv` file is also saved in `./Model/donor` or `./Model/acceptor` containing the metric plots for data inspection and figure adjustment. You can just load these csv files simply by setting `load_csv=True` in `Plot.plot()` which spares a large amount of time of repetitive and monotonous predicting tasks. 

For more examples and instructions, just see the source code.
